							<h2>About  Jainism</h2>

					Jainism is one of the oldest religion known today. It’s not just a religion, it’s a way of living life. Its principals, beliefs and philosophies emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the soul towards divine consciousness and liberation. Yet due to small Jain population not many people know about it. With this Blog we wish to spread Jainism to all parts of the World. <br>
					
					<br>
					
					Jainism dates to the 6th century B.C.E. in India. The religion derives its name from the jinas (“conquerors”), a title given to twenty-four great teachers (tirthankaras or “ford-makers”), through whom their faith was revealed. Mahavira, the last of the tirthankaras, is considered the founder of Jainism. The ultimate goal of Jainism the liberation of the self (jiva) from rebirth, which is attained through the elimination of accumulated karma (the consequences of previous actions). This occurs through both the disciplined cultivation of knowledge and control of bodily passions. When the passions have been utterly conquered and all karma has been removed, one becomes a Jina (“conqueror”), and is no longer subject to rebirth. Jainism conceives of a multi-layered universe containing both heavens and hells. Movement through these levels of the universe requires adherence to the Jainism doctrines emphasizing a peaceful and disciplined life. These principles include non-violence in all parts of life (verbal, physical, and mental), speaking truth, sexual monogamy, and the detachment from material things. As part of the disciplined and non-violent lifestyle, Jains typically are strict vegetarians and often adhere to a quite arduous practice of non-violence, which restricts the sorts of occupations the may follow (no farming, for instance, since insects are inadvertently harmed in plowing). Jainism’s ethical system is based on the idea that right faith, knowledge, and conduct must be cultivated simultaneously.

							<h2>About Bhagavaan Adinath</h2>

					<p>
					Adinath Bhagvaan or Bhagavaan Rishabha was the first Thirthankara of Jains.All the Hindu puranas maintain that Lord Rishabha preached the doctrine of Ahimsa after performing yoga for several  years.
					
					<br><br>
					
					According to jaina tradition, he was a hero of the Ikshvaku family Ayodhya. His father was King Nabhiraja and his mother Queen Marudevi.  He was married to Sumangla and Sunanda. Sumangla gave birth to Bharat, who later became a Chakravarti king . Sunanda gave birth to a child who came to be known as Bahubali.
					
					<br><br>
					Adinath had one hundred sons and two daughters, who were named Brahmi and Sundari.Lord Adinath was a great contributor to the society. It is believed that all civilization was developed from the teachings of Adinath. He taught people how they could obtain food by tilting the soil, that they should take up to agriculture for the production of food. He taught some other people to carry this agriculture produce to different peoples and supply to those that were in need.
					
					<br><br>
					
					He again set apart a numbered of able-bodied men for the purpose of defense. Thus he was the first king to establish the institutions of marriage, agriculture, the arts, and weaponry.
					
					<br><br>
					
					He ruled for thousands of years and after he divided his kingdom among his sons and departed to take up an ascetic way of life to perform Tapas. After the practice of Tapas for several years, he attained Kevalagyana or Omniscience. When Adinath renounced his kingdom, thousands of people followed him into the ascetic life. Whenever they went for alms, people offered them gold, jewels, ornaments, etc. But no one offered them food. Thus, many of his followers could not tolerate the starvation. They began asking for food, and then they left to form their own groups. This was the beginning of many sects.
					
					
					<br><br>
					Adinath also went without food for an entire year. Then he went to his grandson Shreyans kingdom (Hastinapur). His grandson offered him sugarcane juice, which he accepted. Hastinapur is still considered a holy place, and even today Jains make pilgrimages to this site to break ritual fasts (with sugarcane juice).
					
					<br><br>
					After becoming enlightened (Perfect), He broke his silence and preached for many years, telling how to escape the cycle of birth and death and achieve eternal bliss. Bhagwan Adinath achieved Nirvana on the mountain of Kailash in the Himalayas when he was in complete Samadhi.
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>The symbol of Adinath is a Bull (Rishabh) so he is known as Rishabha Dev.</b>
