					Adinath Bhagvaan or Bhagavaan Rishabha was the first Thirthankara of Jains.All the Hindu puranas maintain that Lord Rishabha preached the doctrine of Ahimsa after performing yoga for several  years.

According to jaina tradition, he was a hero of the Ikshvaku family Ayodhya. His father was King Nabhiraja and his mother Queen Marudevi.  He was married to Sumangla and Sunanda. Sumangla gave birth to Bharat, who later became a Chakravarti king . Sunanda gave birth to a child who came to be known as Bahubali. <br><br>

Adinath had one hundred sons and two daughters, who were named Brahmi and Sundari.Lord Adinath was a great contributor to the society. It is believed that all civilization was developed from the teachings of Adinath. He taught people how they could obtain food by tilting the soil, that they should take up to agriculture for the production of food. He taught some other people to carry this agriculture produce to different peoples and supply to those that were in need.
